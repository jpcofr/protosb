# TODO

- Implement the protocol over TCP (It should be possible to list the routes from this router to other routers)
  - Implement flooding (maintain database synchronization)
    - serialize a map and transmit it from a client from a server
  - Routes should age and refreshed

- Understand the protocol
  - Technical reference
  - Read the RFC <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt>

  - Raw socket development
    - Client + Server communicating OSPF packets using raw sockets
    - Listen to artificial TCP packets
    - [Listening on raw sockets](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13082023/raw-socket-listener)
    - [IP SPOOFING with BSD RAW SOCKETS INTERFACE](http://www.enderunix.org/docs/en/rawipspoof/)
    - [Raw socket tutorial](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~steflik/cs455/rawip.txt)
    - Server listens to many clients on different interfaces
    - Send and receive OSPF packages

- Configure many interfaces on container (each of them needs an IP)
- Create a daemon

## Posponed

- [Mixing C and C++ code](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/mixing-c-and-cpp)
- Make the build completely machine independent and autonomous
  - Separate executables for a client and a server on cmake
- Learn to install build essentials or development support directly from the dockerfile
